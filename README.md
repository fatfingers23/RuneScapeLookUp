This is a learning project for Dotnet Core. Just a simple Runescape Hiscore look up.

Somethings that can be added:
* Add Runescape 3 look up. Currently it only looks up Hiscores for OSRS. Try to reuse as much cold without copy/paste of current look up. Along with reusing view. 
* Add a Search bar in the NavBar for look up.
* Add sections for both activites in OSRS and Runescape 3.
